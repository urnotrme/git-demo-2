I can see my baby swingin'
His Parliament's on fire and his hands are up
On the balcony and I'm singing
Ooh, baby, ooh, baby, I'm in love

I can see my sweet boy swayin'
He's crazy y Cubano como yo lala
On the balcony and I'm saying
Move baby, move baby, I'm in love

Down on the West Coast, they got their icons
Their silver starlets, their Queens of Saigon
And you've got the music, you've got the music in you, don't you?
